# Doorbell ML Application

## Description

These applications are designed for doorbell systems, leveraging on-device machine learning to detect the presence of a person within the cameraâ€™s field of view. Upon detection, the system captures and processes images to provide visual context such as high-resolution stills or a sequence of preroll images leading up to the event. This use case combines features from multiple SDK sample applications, including jpeg_preroll and image_stitching, to deliver a comprehensive visual snapshot that enhances detection reliability and situational awareness.
